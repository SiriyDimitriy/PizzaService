How to use this project?
It's very simple.

1. Clone this repository
2. Project contains jdbc configuration for Postgre SQL, if you want to use another DB change file jdbc.properties
3. As mentioned in jdbc.properties you must create empty database with name PizzaServ and check that file's parameters correspond to your DB settings
4. Project's Spring will make all DB tables you need when you firstly run it using Tomcat or another server
5. In order to fill DB with initial data you must go to /app/fill in your browser when application is already deployed

Good luck!
